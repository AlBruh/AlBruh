I’m an aspiring technology professional with passion for web development and cybersecurity. Currently, I’m dedicating my time to studing Web and Multiplatform Development at Core Networks. Meanwhile I’m expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity through self-study, using online platforms and documentation.

My journey into tech began at university, although I eventually decided to leave to pursue a more hands-on approach to learning, I discovered a true passion for technology and problem-solving. This led me to focus on self-guided studies and more practical training.

In my web development studies, I’ve worked on personal projects that taught me a strong foundation in front-end development, the use of version control systems like Git, back-end and systems technologies. I’m excited to bring my skills into a professional environment where I can contribute to building functional, and secure web solutions.

At the same time, my interest in cybersecurity has been growing, as I recognize the importance of safeguarding data and systems in today’s digital world. I discovered a lot of content online to start learning the fundamentals. Later on, I decided to subscribe to some platforms to have a more structured approach to learning and to work on virtual labs. I would like to earn some certifications in the future and continue expanding my knowledge of technology.

As I continue to expand my skills, I’m open to entry-level opportunities in both web development and cybersecurity. I’m eager to join a team where I can contribute my problem-solving abilities. I’m enthusiastic about working in an environment that values continuous growth, collaboration, and innovation.
